# react-tab-set

A `React` component for rendering tabbed content.

```jsx
<TabSet selectedTab='one'>
  <TabGroup>
    <Tab tab='one'>
      One
    </Tab>
    <Tab tab='two'>
      Two
    </Tab>
  </TabGroup>
  <TabPanel tab='one'>
    One
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel tab='two'>
    Two
  </TabPanel>
</TabSet>
```

The `<TabSet />` component manages state, and applies additional props to the `<Tab />` and `<TabPanel />` components.

## _TabSet_

Rendered as a `<div />` the `<TabSet />` component can contain or be contained by an valid children or parent.

A `<TabSet />` has one prop, `selectedTab`. The value of that prop should be the same as the `tab` prop of a `<Tab />` and its paired `<TabPanel />`.

## _TabGroup_ and _Tab_

A `<TabGroup />` contains `<Tab />` components.

These are rendered as `<ul/>` and `<li />` elements, respectively; there should be no elements between them.

A `<TabGroup />` has no props.

Each `<Tab />` component has one prop, `tab`. The value of that prop pairs with the `tab` prop of a `<TabPanel />` component (such that when a `<Tab />` is selected with a click, its paired `<TabPanel />` is rendered).

## _TabPanel_

A `<TabPanel />` is a container for content.

Content can be declared either as children or as the return of a function assigned to its prop `render`.

If your component extends `PureComponent` or is presentational, you might prefer to declare content as children.

Otherwise, you can assign a function to the `render` prop, so that rendering is deferred until the tab is selected.

### Content as children

```jsx
  <TabPanel tab='identifier'>
    <div className='content'>
      Content
    </div>
  </TabPanel>
```

### Content as return

```jsx
  <TabPanel tab='identifier' render={() => (
    <div className='content'>
      Content
    </div>
  )} />
```

(Notice that in this case there is no closing tag; if there were, children would be ignored in favour of the return from the function, anyway.)

### Presentational elements

A `<TabPanel />` component can contain or be contained by an valid children or parent, just like a `<TabSet />`.

```jsx
<TabSet selectedTab='one'>
  { /*
    Etc.
  */ }
  <div className='a'>
    <div className='b'>
      <div className='c'>
        <TabPanel tab='one'>
          One
        </TabPanel>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <TabPanel tab='two' render={() => {
    return 'Two'
  }} />
</TabSet>
```

Similarly, they can be declared in any combination.
